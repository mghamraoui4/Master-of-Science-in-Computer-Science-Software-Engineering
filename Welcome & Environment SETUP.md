### **Basic Concepts of Web Development**

Web development refers to all activities related to the design, creation, and maintenance of websites and web applications that are accessible via the Internet.

It is essential in the context of the Internet because it enables companies, institutions, and individuals to offer services, share information, and interact with users through digital platforms that are accessible at any time and from various devices (computers, mobile phones, and tablets).

### **Knowledge of HTML**

Yes, HTML is a fundamental language of the web. It stands for **HyperText Markup Language**. Its main role is **to structure the content of a web page** (headings, paragraphs, images, links, forms, etc.). It forms the foundation of every web page and allows browsers to display content correctly.

### **Understanding CSS**

Yes, CSS is a language used in conjunction with HTML. CSS stands for **Cascading Style Sheets**. It is used to **define the visual appearance of web pages, including colors, fonts, margins, alignment, and layout.** CSS allows the separation of content (HTML) from presentation, which improves readability, maintainability, and user experience.

**Section 3: JavaScript and Its Importance**

### **Introduction to JavaScript**

Yes, JavaScript is an essential programming language for the web. It enables websites to become dynamic and interactive, for example by handling forms, animations, updating content without page reloads, and managing real-time user interactions. JavaScript is essential because it transforms static web pages into rich and interactive web applications.

**Section 4: Introduction to React and Node.js**
------------------------------------------------

### **Awareness of React and Node.js**

Yes, React and Node.js are modern technologies widely used in web development.

**React** is a JavaScript library used to build dynamic user interfaces, especially single-page applications (SPAs). It facilitates the creation of reusable components and improves performance and maintainability of user interfaces.

**Node.js** is a JavaScript runtime environment on the server side. It allows developers to build backend applications, APIs, and high-performance web services, often used in combination with databases.
